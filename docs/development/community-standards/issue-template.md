Issue templates, such as `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md`, are vital components for managing software repositories. They help standardize the way users submit issuesâ€”bugs, feature requests, or any other types of reports. This standardization makes it easier for project maintainers to understand and address these issues.

Issue templates are typically located in the repository's `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` directory. They should be named to reflect their purpose (e.g., `bug_report.md`, `feature_request.md`) and should be written in Markdown.

An example of a bug report template might look like this:

```markdown title="/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md"
---
name: Bug report
about: Create a report to help us improve
title: ''
labels: 'bug'
assignees: ''

---

**Describe the bug**

**To Reproduce**

4. See error

**Expected behavior**

**Screenshots**

```

An example of a feature request template might look like this:

```markdown title="/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md"
---
name: Feature request

title: ''
labels: 'enhancement'
assignees: ''
