# Why Use Kebab Case in Repository Naming?

## Overview

In our GitHub Repository Naming Convention Guide, we have recommended using kebab-case for naming repositories. This section elaborates on why kebab-case is preferred over other naming conventions such as snake_case or camelCase.

## Advantages of Kebab-Case

1. **URL Friendliness:** The most significant advantage of kebab-case is its compatibility with URLs. Browsers interpret spaces in URLs as `%20`, which makes the URL hard to read. Kebab-case, with its hyphen-separated syntax, makes URLs more readable and user-friendly.

2. **Universally Recognized:** Kebab-case does not rely on capitalization to separate words, making it easy to read across various cultures and languages. Unlike camelCase, which could be difficult to interpret for individuals unfamiliar with the convention, kebab-case is straightforward and intuitive.

3. **System Compatibility:** Some systems interpret capital letters in camelCase as commands or different characters, which can lead to errors. Kebab-case avoids this issue by using only lowercase letters.

4. **Visual Clarity:** Kebab-case improves readability by visually separating words with hyphens. This makes long and complex repository names easier to understand at a glance.

## Conclusion

While naming conventions largely depend on personal or organizational preference, kebab-case offers several advantages that make it an excellent choice for GitHub repository names. Its compatibility with URLs, universal recognition, system compatibility, and visual clarity contribute to a streamlined and efficient coding environment. By using kebab-case, we ensure that our repository names are accessible and understandable to everyone in the organization.
