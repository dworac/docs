# Exceptions and Edge Cases

Sometimes, a repository might not fit neatly into the `{technology}-{project}-{module}` format. Here are a few examples of how to handle these situations:

1. **Multi-Technology Repositories:** If a repository uses multiple technologies, you can use the one that is most representative or the one used the most. For instance, if you have a Full Stack application using both React and Node.js, you might name it `react-node-fullstack-app`.

2. **Common Libraries or Utilities:** If a repository is a common library or utility used across several projects, it might not have a specific project name. In this case, you could use `lib` or `util` as the project name. For instance: `java-lib-logging` or `python-util-data-cleaning`.

3. **Documentation Repositories:** If a repository is used for documentation, you could use `doc` as the technology. For instance: `doc-ecommerce-api` for the API documentation of the Ecommerce project.

Remember, the goal of these guidelines is to create clear, descriptive repository names. If a name doesn't seem clear, consider whether there's a better way to structure it.
