# Repository Naming Convention


## Purpose

This guide standardizes the naming of GitHub repositories within our organization to increase clarity, searchability, and consistency. Adherence to this guide ensures that our repositories are easy to locate and understand, facilitating collaboration and communication.

## Naming Convention

Our naming convention comprises three key components separated by hyphens: `{technology}-{project}-{module}`.

1. **Technology:** The primary technology or programming language used in the repository. This could include `python`, `java`, `react`, `nodejs`, etc. This tag aids developers in identifying the principal technology stack used in the project.

2. **Project:** The name of the broader project or initiative that the repository belongs to. This could include `payment-system`, `user-authentication`, `data-analytics`, etc. This tag helps categorize repositories by their overarching project or function.

3. **Module/Repo:** This tag refers to the specific function of the code in the repository. This could be `frontend`, `backend`, `api`, `database`, etc. In the case of repositories that contain a microservice or a library, this tag could represent its specific purpose.

By combining these components, repository names like `react-ecommerce-frontend`, `java-payment-system-api`, and `python-data-analytics-processing` can be formed.

## Additional Guidelines

- **Clarity:** Ensure that the repository names are understandable even to newcomers. Avoid using acronyms or jargon unless they are widely recognized.

- **Consistency:** Apply these rules consistently across all repositories. Consistency reduces confusion and aids in quickly identifying the purpose of a repository.

- **Simplicity:** The naming convention should be simple but informative. Avoid including unnecessary information, but also don't omit information that aids in identifying the repository's purpose.

- **Searchability:** Use terms that are likely to be included in search queries to increase the visibility of the repository.

- **Uniqueness:** Each repository name within the organization should be unique to avoid confusion and facilitate specific repository searches.

- **Avoid Special Characters:** Stick to lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens to prevent potential issues with certain systems.

## Conclusion

Adherence to this guide will ensure a high level of organization and clarity across all GitHub repositories within our organization. This will help facilitate collaboration and communication among team members, ultimately contributing to more effective and efficient development processes.
