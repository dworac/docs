# Example Section

This section will provide concrete examples of branch naming according to our conventions.

**1. Feature Branches**

Suppose you are working on a new feature that involves adding a search bar to your application. The ticket number for this feature in your project management tool is 235. Following the convention, your branch name would be: `feature/235-add-search-bar`

**2. Bug Fixes**

Imagine you are fixing a bug that prevents users from updating their profile. The ticket number for this bug in your project management tool is 764. The appropriate branch name would be: `bugfix/764-fix-profile-update`

**3. Hot Fixes**

If there's an urgent need to resolve a problem in your live application, for instance, a server crash issue, and the ticket number is 999. The branch name would be: `hotfix/999-fix-server-crash`

**4. Refactor**

Assume you're refactoring the code related to the comments section of a blog post, and your task is tracked with ticket number 333. The branch name would be: `refactor/333-refactor-comments-section`

**5. Experimental / Research**

When you're researching a potential new feature like implementing push notifications and the ticket number is 666. The branch name would be: `research/666-implement-push-notifications`

Remember, these are just examples and your actual task descriptions will be specific to your project.
