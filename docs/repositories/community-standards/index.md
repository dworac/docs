# Community Standards

These guidelines are inspired by the [GitHub Community Guidelines](https://opensource.guide/).

:::info
These guidelines are mainly focused on working on GitHub, but the same principles can be applied to other Git hosting services.

:::caution
Not adhering to these guidelines will result in an audit failure.
