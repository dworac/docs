# Introduction

In this section, we will outline the standard procedures and guidelines for working with Git branches within our software development workflow. Good naming conventions are essential for team collaboration and project management.

## Branch Naming Convention

The primary purposes of having a proper naming convention for Git branches are to maintain organization, ease of access, and understanding the purpose of different branches.

(See [Branch Naming Convention](./branch-naming-convention) for more information.)

## Community Standards

They help to maintain a healthy and productive environment for all contributors.
These guidelines are inspired by the [GitHub Community Guidelines](https://opensource.guide/).

See [Community Standards](./community-standards) for more information.

## Repository Naming Convention

The primary purposes of having a proper naming convention for Git repositories are to maintain organization, ease of access, and understanding the purpose of different repositories.

(See [Repository Naming Convention](./repository-naming-convention) for more information.)

## Trunk-Based Development

Trunk-Based Development (TBD) is a software development practice where developers work on a single branch (usually the `main` branch) and commit their changes directly to that branch. TBD is the default development workflow for this project.

(See [Trunk-Based Development](./trunk-based-development) for more information.)
