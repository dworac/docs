# Repositories Guidelines

We are going to cover in depth the guidelines for repositories. This will help ensure that all repositories are consistent and follow the best practices.

### Trunk-Based Development

Trunk-Based Development (TBD) is a software development practice where developers work on a single branch (usually the `main` branch) and commit their changes directly to that branch. TBD is the default development workflow for this project.

(See [Trunk-Based Development](./trunk-based-development) for more information.)

### Naming Convention

The primary purposes of having a proper naming convention for Git repositories are to maintain organization, ease of access, and understanding the purpose of different repositories.

(See [Repository Naming Convention](./repository-naming-convention) for more information.)

### Branch Naming Convention

The primary purposes of having a proper naming convention for Git branches are to maintain organization, ease of access, and understanding the purpose of different branches.

(See [Branch Naming Convention](./branch-naming-convention) for more information.)

### Community Standards

They help to maintain a healthy and productive environment for all contributors.
These guidelines are inspired by the [GitHub Community Guidelines](https://opensource.guide/).

See [Community Standards](./community-standards) for more information.

### Settings

Using the repository-settings Probot app, this allows us to define the repository settings from inside the repository itself. This allows us to have a single source of truth for all repository settings.

(See [Repository Settings](./settings) for more information.)

### Changelog

The primary purpose of having a changelog is to keep track of all notable changes made to a project. It helps to maintain a record of all the changes made to the project and also helps to keep the contributors and users informed about the changes.

(See [Changelog](./changelog) for more information.)
